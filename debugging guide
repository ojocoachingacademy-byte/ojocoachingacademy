Before you make ANY code changes, follow this debugging process:

STEP 1 - GATHER INFORMATION:
- What is the exact symptom? (What's broken, when does it happen, what's the expected behavior?)
- What clues do I have? (What DOES work? What patterns exist?)
- Can you reproduce it reliably? Under what conditions?

STEP 2 - ANALYZE THE SYSTEM:
- List all relevant files and their interactions
- Identify all components involved (HTML structure, CSS rules, JS functions, event listeners)
- Map out the data flow or rendering pipeline
- Check for: z-index conflicts, pointer-events, overlays, event bubbling, CSS specificity, stacking contexts

STEP 3 - FORM HYPOTHESES:
List 3-5 potential root causes, ranked by likelihood:
1. [Most likely cause] - because [reasoning]
2. [Second likely] - because [reasoning]
3. [etc.]

STEP 4 - ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS:
Before proposing solutions, ask me:
- [Any missing information you need]
- [Specific behaviors to test]
- [Which hypothesis seems most likely based on my experience]

STEP 5 - PROPOSE SOLUTION:
Only after completing steps 1-4, propose:
- The ROOT CAUSE (not just the symptom)
- WHY this causes the observed behavior
- The minimal fix that addresses the root cause
- How to verify the fix worked

Do NOT:
- Jump straight to code changes
- Make incremental "try this" suggestions without explaining why
- Fix symptoms without identifying root causes
- Assume you know the answer without analysis

Start your response with: "🔍 DEBUGGING ANALYSIS:" and work through each step.

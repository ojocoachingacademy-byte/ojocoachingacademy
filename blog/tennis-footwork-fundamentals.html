                <h1>Tennis Footwork Fundamentals: Move Like a Pro</h1>
                <p class="blog-post-excerpt">Great footwork is the foundation of great tennis. Many players focus on their strokes but neglect their movement. In this guide, I'll teach you the fundamental footwork patterns that will improve your court coverage and shot quality.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="blog-post-body">
                <h2>Why Footwork Matters</h2>
                <p>You can have perfect technique, but if you're not in the right position, you'll never hit a good shot. Professional tennis players spend countless hours on footwork drills because they know that movement is what separates great players from good ones.</p>
                <p>Good footwork allows you to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Get to the ball in time to set up properly</li>
                    <li>Maintain balance while hitting</li>
                    <li>Recover quickly after each shot</li>
                    <li>Cover more court efficiently</li>
                    <li>Hit with more power and control</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Split-Step</h2>
                <p><strong>The Foundation of Tennis Movement</strong></p>
                <p>The split-step is a small hop you make just as your opponent is about to hit the ball. It's crucial for quick movement in any direction.</p>
                <p><strong>How to do it:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Stand on the balls of your feet, knees slightly bent</li>
                    <li>As your opponent prepares to hit, perform a small jump (about 2-4 inches)</li>
                    <li>Land with your feet shoulder-width apart, weight evenly distributed</li>
                    <li>Be ready to move in any direction immediately</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Common mistakes:</strong> Timing the split-step too early or too late, landing flat-footed, or not being ready to move after landing.</p>

                <h2>Lateral Movement Patterns</h2>
                <p><strong>Side Shuffle:</strong> For moving sideways short distances (2-3 steps). Keep your feet parallel, don't cross them, and maintain a low center of gravity.</p>
                <p><strong>Crossover Step:</strong> For covering longer distances. Step with your outside foot, then cross your inside foot over. This is faster than shuffling for longer moves.</p>
                <p><strong>Scissor Step:</strong> For quick direction changes. Used when you need to reverse direction quickly.</p>

                <h2>Approach Shots & Net Play</h2>
                <p>When approaching the net:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Hit your approach shot and immediately move forward</li>
                    <li>Take small, quick steps (don't take huge strides)</li>
                    <li>Split-step as your opponent is about to hit</li>
                    <li>Be ready to volley or overhead</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The key is to continue moving forward after your shot, not stopping and waiting.</p>

                <h2>Recovery Footwork</h2>
                <p>After hitting a shot, you need to recover to the optimal court position:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>After baseline shots:</strong> Recover to the center of the court, adjusting based on where you hit the ball</li>
                    <li><strong>After wide shots:</strong> Recover quickly back to center - don't stay wide</li>
                    <li><strong>After volleys:</strong> Split-step and be ready, you're already at the net</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Good recovery puts you in position for the next shot and prevents your opponent from catching you out of position.</p>

                <h2>Footwork for Different Shots</h2>
                <p><strong>Forehand:</strong> Step into the shot with your non-dominant foot (right foot for right-handers). This transfers weight forward and generates power.</p>
                <p><strong>Backhand:</strong> Step forward with your dominant foot, turning your body sideways. Keep your shoulders turned until contact.</p>
                <p><strong>Serve:</strong> Start with feet shoulder-width apart, step forward with your front foot as you toss, and transfer weight from back to front foot.</p>
                <p><strong>Volley:</strong> Small, quick adjustment steps. Don't take big steps - precision over power at the net.</p>

                <h2>Footwork Drills to Practice</h2>
                <p><strong>1. Cone Drill:</strong> Place cones around the court and practice moving between them using different footwork patterns.</p>
                <p><strong>2. Split-Step Drill:</strong> Have someone feed balls from different positions. Practice split-stepping before each shot.</p>
                <p><strong>3. Shadow Drilling:</strong> Practice footwork patterns without a ball. Focus on proper technique.</p>
                <p><strong>4. Agility Ladder:</strong> Improves quick feet and coordination.</p>

                <h2>Common Footwork Mistakes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lazy feet:</strong> Not moving between shots - stay active!</li>
                    <li><strong>Big steps:</strong> Taking huge strides instead of small, quick steps</li>
                    <li><strong>Flat feet:</strong> Not staying on the balls of your feet</li>
                    <li><strong>Poor recovery:</strong> Not getting back into position after shots</li>
                    <li><strong>No split-step:</strong> Missing this crucial movement makes you slow to react</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Putting It All Together</h2>
                <p>Great footwork becomes automatic with practice. Start by focusing on one element at a time - perhaps the split-step or recovery patterns. As these become natural, add more complexity.</p>
                <p>Remember: Good footwork makes everything else easier. When you're in the right position, your strokes become more powerful, accurate, and consistent.</p>
